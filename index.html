		Keyboard keys typically have a set of characters engraved or printed on them, and each press of a key typically<br>
	  corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require pressing and holding several keys<br>
	  simultaneously or in sequence. While most keys produce characters , other keys can prompt the computer to execute<br>
	  system commands. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software: the information<br>
	  sent to the computer, the scan code, tells it only which physical key was pressed or released. In normal usage,<br>
	  the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text, numbers, and symbols into application software<br>
	  such as a word processor, web browser or social media app.<br>

  <div class="section">
		Desktop computer keyboards include alphabetic characters and numerals, typographical symbols and punctuation marks,<br>
	  one or more currency symbols and other special characters, diacritics and a variety of function keys. The repertoire<br>
	  of glyphs engraved on the keys of a keyboard accords with national conventions and language needs. Computer keyboards<br>
	  are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command key or Windows keys.<br>
	</div>
	<div class="link">
		Flexible keyboards are a junction between normal type and laptop type keyboards: normal from the full<br>
	  arrangement of keys, and laptop from the short key distance. Additionally, the flexibility allows the<br>
	  user to fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer. However, for typing the keyboard must<br>
	  be resting on a hard surface. The vast majority of flexible keyboards in the market are made from<br>
	  silicone; this material makes them water- and dust-proof. This is useful in hospitals, where keyboards<br>
	  are subjected to frequent washing, and other dirty or must-be-clean environments.

		Multifunctional keyboards may feature customised keypads, fully programmable function or soft keys for macros/pre-sets,<br>
	  biometric or smart card readers, trackballs, etc. New generation multifunctional keyboards feature a touchscreen display to<br>
	  stream video, control audio visual media and alarms, execute application inputs, configure individual desktop environments,<br>
	  etc. Multifunctional keyboards may also permit users to share access to PCs and other information sources. Multiple interfaces<br>
	  are used to integrate external devices. Some multifunctional keyboards are also used to directly and intuitively control video walls.

		Multifunctional keyboards provide additional function beyond the standard keyboard. Many are programmable, configurable computer<br>
	  keyboards and some control multiple PCs, workstations and other information sources, usually in multi-screen work environments.<br>
	  Users have additional key functions as well as the standard functions and can typically use a single keyboard and mouse to access multiple sources.

		Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter<br>
	  keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program,text editor, data<br>
	  spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier<br>
	  keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key<br>
	  or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when<br>
	  the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other<br>
	  functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys. The Space bar is a horizontal<br>
	  bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys.

    Also known as photo-optical keyboard, light responsive keyboard,<br>
	  photo-electric keyboard and optical key actuation detection technology.<br>
    An optical keyboard technology utilizes LEDs and photo sensors<br>
	  to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and<br>
	  sensors are located in the perimeter, mounted on a small PCB.<br>
	  The light is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior<br>
	  and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical<br>
	  keyboards require at least 2 beams  to determine the actuated key.<br>
	  Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks<br>
	  the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys.

	<div class="technology-two">
		The technology of computer keyboards includes many elements.<br>
	  Among the more important of these is the switch technology<br>
	  that they use. Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically<br>
	  have 80 to 110 durable switches, generally one for each key.<br>
	  The choice of switch technology affects key response  and <br>
	  pre-travel. Virtual keyboards on touch screens have no physical<br>
	  switches and provide audio and haptic feedback instead. Some newer<br>
	  keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve<br>
	  greater cost savings or better ergonomics.
